# Guerrilla Analytics Framework
During the lessons workflows I learned to work following the Guerrilla analytics framework principles.

We learned multiple things here such as

  - Working in Github for version control.
  - Automating things.
  - And maintaning an organized folder structure.

Here I ordered the folder structure from a fellow classmates daur2 folders, I divided everthing into seperate projects te keep everthing clear and easy to find.

```{r}
fs::dir_tree("daur2_correct_structure")
```
